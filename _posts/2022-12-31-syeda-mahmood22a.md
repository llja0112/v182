abstract: The ability to search in unstructured reports of electronic health records
  requires tools that can recognize clinically meaningful fine-grained descriptions
  both in queries and in report sentences. Existing methods of searching reports that
  use either information retrieval or deep learning techniques to model use context,
  lack an inherent understanding of the clinical concepts or their variants that capture
  the same underlying clinical semantics. In this paper, we present a new search algorithm
  that combines principles of information retrieval and deep learning-driven textual
  encoding approaches with natural language analysis of sentences in reports for fine-grained
  descriptors of concepts. In particular, we learn a clinical similarity-preserving
  embedding from a chest X-ray lexicon using a new contrastive loss. This allows us
  to form a report index that is robust to different forms of expressing for clinical
  concepts in queries. The results show marked improvement in the quality of retrieved
  reports as judged through average recall and mean average precision over a broad
  range of difficult queries.
