abstract: 'Medical events of interest, such as mortality, often happen at a low rate
  in electronic medical records, as most admitted patients survive. Training models
  with this imbalance rate (class density discrepancy) may lead to suboptimal prediction.
  Traditionally this problem is addressed through ad-hoc methods such as resampling
  or reweighting but performance in many cases is still limited. We propose a framework
  for training models for this imbalance issue: 1) we first decouple the feature extraction
  and classification process, adjusting training batches separately for each component
  to mitigate bias caused by class density discrepancy; 2) we train the network with
  both a density-aware loss and a learnable cost matrix for misclassifications. We
  demonstrate our modelâ€™s improved performance in real-world medical datasets (TOPCAT
  and MIMIC-III) to show improved AUC-ROC, AUC-PRC, Brier Skill Score compared with
  the baselines in the domain.'
