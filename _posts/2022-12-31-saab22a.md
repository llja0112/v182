abstract: 'A common failure mode of neural networks trained to classify abnormalities
  in medical images is their reliance on spurious features, which are features that
  are associated with the class label but are non-generalizable. In this work, we
  examine if supervising models with increased spatial specificity (i.e., information
  about the location of the abnormality) impacts model reliance on spurious features.
  We first propose a data model of spurious features and theoretically analyze the
  impact of increasing spatial specificity. We find that two properties of the data
  are impacted when we increase spatial specificity: the variance of the positively-labeled
  input pixels decreases and the mutual information between abnormal and spurious
  pixels decreases, both of which contribute to improved model robustness to spurious
  features. However, supervising models with greater spatial specificity incurs higher
  annotation costs, since training data must be labeled for the location of the abnormality,
  leading to a trade-off between annotation costs and model robustness to spurious
  features. We investigate this trade-off by varying the coarseness of the spatial
  specificity supplied and sweeping the quantity of training samples that have information
  about the abnormality location. Further, we assess if semi-supervised and contrastive
  learning methods improve the cost-robustness trade-off. We empirically examine the
  impact of supervising models with increased spatial specificity on two medical image
  datasets known to have spurious features: pneumothorax classification on chest x-rays
  and melanoma classification from dermoscopic images. We find that while models supervised
  with binary labels have near-random robust performance (robust AUROC of 0.46), increasing
  spatial specificity to bounding box detection and image segmentation achieves a
  robust AUROC of 0.72 and 0.82, respectively, on the pneumothorax classification
  task. We also observe this trend for the melanoma task, where segmentation models
  achieve a robust AUROC of 0.73, compared to worse than random performance for models
  trained with binary labels. Moreover, by leveraging semi-supervised and contrastive
  methods, models achieve a 5 point gain in robust AUROC when we have access to very
  few training samples.'
