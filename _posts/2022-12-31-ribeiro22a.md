abstract: Recent work on neuroimaging has demonstrated significant benefits of using
  population graphs to capture non-imaging information in the prediction of neurodegenerative
  and neurodevelopmental disorders. These non-imaging attributes may not only contain
  demographic information about the individuals, e.g. age or sex, but also the acquisition
  site, as imaging protocols and hardware might significantly differ across sites
  in large-scale studies. The effect of the latter is particularly prevalent in functional
  connectomics studies, where it remains unclear how to sufficiently homogenise fMRI
  signals across the different sites. In addition, recent studies have highlighted
  the need to investigate potential biases in the classifiers devised using large-scale
  datasets, which might be imbalanced in terms of one or more sensitive attributes.
  This can be exacerbated when employing these attributes in a population graph to
  explicitly introduce inductive biases to the machine learning model and lead to
  disparate predictive performance across sub-populations. This study scrutinises
  such a system and aims to uncover potential biases of a semi-supervised classifier
  that relies on a population graph. We further explore the effect of the graph structure
  and stratification strategies, as well as methods to mitigate such biases and produce
  fairer predictions across the population.
