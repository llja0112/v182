abstract: We propose a novel anomaly detection method for echocardiogram videos. The
  introduced method takes advantage of the periodic nature of the heart cycle to learn
  three variants of a variational latent trajectory model (TVAE). While the first
  two variants (TVAE-C and TVAE-R) model strict periodic movements of the heart, the
  third (TVAE-S) is more general and allows shifts in the spatial representation throughout
  the video. All models are trained on the healthy samples of a novel in-house dataset
  of infant echocardiogram videos consisting of multiple chamber views to learn a
  normative prior of the healthy population. During inference, maximum a posteriori
  (MAP) based anomaly detection is performed to detect out-of-distribution samples
  in our dataset. The proposed method reliably identifies severe congenital heart
  defects, such as Ebsteinâ€™s Anomaly or Shone-complex. Moreover, it achieves superior
  performance over MAP-based anomaly detection with standard variational autoencoders
  when detecting pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular dilation. Finally, we
  demonstrate that the proposed method enables interpretable explanations of its output
  through heatmaps highlighting the regions corresponding to anomalous heart structures.
