abstract: People often interpret clinical prediction models to detect ‘risk factors’,
  i.e. to identify variables associated to the outcome. We shed light on the stability
  of prediction models by performing a large-scale experiment developing over 450
  prediction models using LASSO logistic regression and investigating model changes
  across databases (care settings) and phenotype definitions. Our results show that
  model stability, as measured by the similarity of selected variables, is poor across
  the prediction tasks but slightly better for the top (i.e. most important) variables.
  Differences in the top variables are mostly due to database choice and not due to
  using different target population and/or outcome phenotype definitions. However,
  this means using a different database might lead to finding different ‘risk factors’.
  Furthermore, we found the effect (i.e. sign) of variables is not always the same
  across models, which makes clinical interpretation of potential ‘risk factors’ difficult.
  This study shows it is important to be careful when using LASSO regression to identify
  ‘risk factors’ and not to over-interpret the developed models in general. For ‘risk
  factor’ detection, we recommend investigating model robustness across settings or
  using alternative methods (e.g. univariate analysis).
