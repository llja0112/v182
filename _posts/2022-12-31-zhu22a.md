abstract: There has been an increased interest in applying deep neural networks to
  automatically interpret and analyze the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). The current
  paradigms with machine learning methods are often limited by the amount of labeled
  data. This phenomenon is particularly problematic for clinically-relevant data,
  where labeling at scale can be time-consuming and costly in terms of the specialized
  expertise and human effort required. Moreover, deep learning classifiers may be
  vulnerable to adversarial examples and perturbations, which could have catastrophic
  consequences, for example, when applied in the context of medical treatment, clinical
  trials, or insurance claims. In this paper, we propose a physiologically-inspired
  data augmentation method to improve performance and increase the robustness of heart
  disease detection based on ECG signals. We obtain augmented samples by perturbing
  the data distribution towards other classes along the geodesic in Wasserstein space.
  To better utilize domain-specific knowledge, we design a ground metric that recognizes
  the difference between ECG signals based on physiologically determined features.
  Learning from 12-lead ECG signals, our model is able to distinguish five categories
  of cardiac conditions. Our results demonstrate improvements in accuracy and robustness,
  reflecting the effectiveness of our data augmentation method.
