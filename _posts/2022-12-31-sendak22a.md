abstract: 'The approaches by which the machine learning and clinical research communities
  utilize real world data (RWD), including data captured in the electronic health
  record (EHR), vary dramatically. While clinical researchers cautiously use RWD for
  clinical investigations, ML for healthcare teams consume public datasets with minimal
  scrutiny to develop new algorithms. This study bridges this gap by developing and
  validating ML-DQA, a data quality assurance framework grounded in RWD best practices.
  The ML-DQA framework is applied to five ML projects across two geographies, different
  medical conditions, and different cohorts. A total of 2,999 quality checks and 24
  quality reports were generated on RWD gathered on 247,536 patients across the five
  projects. Five generalizable practices emerge: all projects used a similar method
  to group redundant data element representations; all projects used automated utilities
  to build diagnosis and medication data elements; all projects used a common library
  of rules-based transformations; all projects used a unified approach to assign data
  quality checks to data elements; and all projects used a similar approach to clinical
  adjudication. An average of 5.8 individuals, including clinicians, data scientists,
  and trainees, were involved in implementing ML-DQA for each project and an average
  of 23.4 data elements per project were either transformed or removed in response
  to ML-DQA. This study demonstrates the importance role of ML-DQA in healthcare projects
  and provides teams a framework to conduct these essential activities.'
