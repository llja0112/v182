abstract: With the growing availability of Electronic Health Records (EHRs), many
  deep learning methods have been developed to leverage such datasets in medical prediction
  tasks. Notably, transformer-based architectures have proven to be highly effective
  for EHRs. Transformer-based architectures are generally very effective in “transferring”
  the acquired knowledge from very large datasets to smaller target datasets through
  their comprehensive “pre-training” process. However, to work efficiently, they still
  rely on the target datasets for the downstream tasks, and if the target dataset
  is (very) small, the performance of downstream models can degrade rapidly. In biomedical
  applications, it is common to only have access to small datasets, for instance,
  when studying rare diseases, invasive procedures, or using restrictive cohort selection
  processes. In this study, we present CEHR-GAN-BERT, a semi-supervised transformer-based
  architecture that leverages both in and out-of-cohort patients to learn better patient
  representations in the context of few-shot learning. The proposed method opens new
  learning opportunities where only a few hundred samples are available. We extensively
  evaluate our method on four prediction tasks and three public datasets showing the
  ability of our model to achieve improvements upwards of 5% on all performance metrics
  (including AUROC and F1 Score) on the tasks that use less than 200 annotated patients
  during the training process.
