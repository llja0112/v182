abstract: Early diagnosis of disease can lead to improved health outcomes, including
  higher survival rates and lower treatment costs. With the massive amount of information
  available in electronic health records (EHRs), there is great potential to use machine
  learning (ML) methods to model disease progression aimed at early prediction of
  disease onset and other outcomes. In this work, we employ recent innovations in
  neural ODEs combined with rich semantic embeddings of clinical codes to harness
  the full temporal information of EHRs. We propose ICE-NODE (Integration of Clinical
  Embeddings with Neural Ordinary Differential Equations), an architecture that temporally
  integrates embeddings of clinical codes and neural ODEs to learn and predict patient
  trajectories in EHRs. We apply our method to the publicly available MIMIC-III and
  MIMIC-IV datasets, and we find improved prediction results compared to state-of-the-art
  methods, specifically for clinical codes that are not frequently observed in EHRs.
  We also show that ICE-NODE is more competent at predicting certain medical conditions,
  like acute renal failure, pulmonary heart disease and birth-related problems, where
  the full temporal information could provide important information. Furthermore,
  ICE-NODE is also able to produce patient risk trajectories over time that can be
  exploited for further detailed predictions of disease evolution.
