abstract: As machine learning (ML) shows vast potential in real world applications,
  the number of deployed models has been increasing substantially, but little attention
  has been devoted to validating/improving model performance over time. Model updates,
  sometimes frequent, are essential to dealing with data shift, policy changes and
  in general, to improving the model performance. Updating also presents significant
  risks to amplifying model errors if effort is not put into preventing it. Unfortunately
  very little analysis is done to date of what can happen as models are deployed and
  become a part of the decision making process, where there is no longer a way to
  disentangle human from machine error in the collected labels. The phenomenon of
  interest is termed error amplification where model errors corrupt future labels,
  and are reinforced by updates eventually causing the model to predict its own outputs
  instead of the labels of interest. We analyze various factors influencing the magnitude
  of error amplification, and provide guidance for model and threshold selection when
  error amplification is a risk. We demonstrate that a variety of learning techniques
  cannot handle the systematic way in which error amplification corrupts observed
  outcomes. Additionally, we discuss both procedural and modeling solutions to reduce
  model deterioration over time based on our empirical evaluations.
