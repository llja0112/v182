abstract: Surgical procedures have a clear designated goal, which makes the art of
  performing surgery a task-oriented action. The performing surgeon follows specific
  workflow steps that describe the actions needed to reach the surgery goal. In ectomy
  procedures, such as Cholecystectomy and Appendectomy, the goal is to dissect and
  remove a specific organ. Safety measures are set to prevent injuries, and the surgeon
  needs to follow protective methods to avoid misidentification. In Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy
  (LC), this method is known as Critical View of Safety (CVS). This work illustrates
  that machine learning can detect CVS accurately enough to be used routinely in the
  clinical setting, both for educational purposes and in other assessment scenarios.
  We formulate CVS detection as a supervised Multi Instance Learning (MIL) problem
  and propose an attention-based MIL model that is trained and evaluated on more than
  2,000 surgical videos. It achieves 82.6% mean unweighted accuracy in detecting LC
  CVS criteria and 84.2% accuracy in the final task of CVS detection.
