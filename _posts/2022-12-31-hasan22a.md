abstract: Causal discovery is an important problem in many sciences that enables us
  to estimate causal relationships from observational data. Particularly, in the healthcare
  domain, it can guide practitioners in making informed clinical decisions. Several
  causal discovery approaches have been developed over the last few decades. The success
  of these approaches mostly rely on a large number of data samples. In practice,
  however, an infinite amount of data is never available. Fortunately, often we have
  some prior knowledge available from the problem domain. Particularly, in healthcare
  settings, we often have some prior knowledge such as expert opinions, prior RCTs,
  literature evidence, and systematic reviews about the clinical problem. This prior
  information can be utilized in a systematic way to address the data scarcity problem.
  However, most of the existing causal discovery approaches lack a systematic way
  to incorporate prior knowledge during the search process. Recent advances in reinforcement
  learning techniques can be explored to use prior knowledge as constraints by penalizing
  the agent for their violations. Therefore, in this work, we propose a framework
  KCRL 1 that utilizes the existing knowledge as a constraint to penalize the search
  process during causal discovery. This utilization of existing information during
  causal discovery reduces the graph search space and enables a faster convergence
  to the optimal causal mechanism. We evaluated our framework on benchmark synthetic
  and real datasets as well as on a real-life healthcare application. We also compared
  its performance with several baseline causal discovery methods. The experimental
  findings show that penalizing the search process for constraint violation yields
  better performance compared to existing approaches that do not utilize prior knowledge.
