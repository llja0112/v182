abstract: Effective learning from electronic health records (EHR) data for prediction
  of clinical outcomes is often challenging because of features recorded at irregular
  timesteps and loss to follow-up as well as competing events such as death or disease
  progression. To that end, we propose a generative time-to-event model, SurvLatent
  ODE, which adopts an Ordinary Differential Equation-based Recurrent Neural Networks
  (ODE-RNN) as an encoder to effectively parameterize dynamics of latent states under
  irregularly sampled input data. Our model then utilizes the resulting latent embedding
  to flexibly estimate survival times for multiple competing events without specifying
  shapes of event-specific hazard function. We demonstrate competitive performance
  of our model on MIMIC-III, a freely-available longitudinal dataset collected from
  critical care units, on predicting hospital mortality as well as the data from the
  Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) on predicting onset of Venous Thromboembolism
  (VTE), a life-threatening complication for patients with cancer, with death as a
  competing event. SurvLatent ODE outperforms the current clinical standard Khorana
  Risk scores for stratifying VTE risk groups, while providing clinically meaningful
  and interpretable latent representations.
