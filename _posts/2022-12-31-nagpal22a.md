abstract: Applications of machine learning in healthcare often require working with
  time-to-event prediction tasks including prognostication of an adverse event, re-hospitalization,
  and mortality. Such outcomes are typically subject to censoring due to loss of follow
  up. Standard machine learning methods cannot be applied in a straightforward manner
  to datasets with censored outcomes. In this paper, we present auton-survival, an
  open-source repository of tools to streamline working with censored time-to-event
  or survival data. auton-survival includes tools for survival regression, adjustment
  in the presence of domain shift, counterfactual estimation, phenotyping for risk
  stratification, evaluation, as well as estimation of treatment effects. Through
  real world case studies employing a large subset of the SEER oncology incidence
  data, we demonstrate the ability of auton-survival to rapidly support data scientists
  in answering complex health and epidemiological questions.
