abstract: 'Dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) are used in medicine to tailor sequential
  treatment decisions to patients by considering patient heterogeneity. Common methods
  for learning optimal DTRs, however, have shortcomings: they are typically based
  on outcome prediction and not treatment effect estimation, or they use linear models
  that are restrictive for patient data from modern electronic health records. To
  address these shortcomings, we develop two novel methods for learning optimal DTRs
  that effectively handle complex patient data. We call our methods DTR causal trees
  (DTR-CT) and DTR causal forest (DTR-CF). Our methods are based on a data-driven
  estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects using causal tree methods, specifically
  causal trees and causal forests, that learn non-linear relationships, control for
  time-varying confounding, are doubly robust, and explainable. To the best of our
  knowledge, our paper is the first that adapts causal tree methods for learning optimal
  DTRs. We evaluate our proposed methods using synthetic data and then apply them
  to real-world data from intensive care units. Our methods outperform state-of-the-art
  baselines in terms of cumulative regret and percentage of optimal decisions by a
  considerable margin. Our work improves treatment recommendations from electronic
  health record and is thus of direct relevance for personalized medicine.'
