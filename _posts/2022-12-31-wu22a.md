abstract: Despite machine learning models’ state-of-the-art performance in numerous
  clinical prediction and intervention tasks, their complex black-box processes pose
  a great barrier to their real-world deployment. Clinical experts must be able to
  understand the reasons behind a model’s recommendation before taking action, as
  it is crucial to assess for criteria other than accuracy, such as trust, safety,
  fairness, and robustness. In this work, we enable human inspection of clinical timeseries
  prediction models by learning concepts, or groupings of features into high-level
  clinical ideas such as illness severity or kidney function. We also propose an optimization
  method which then selects the most important features within each concept, learning
  a collection of sparse prediction models that are sufficiently expressive for examination.
  On a real-world task of predicting vasopressor onset in ICU units, our algorithm
  achieves predictive performance comparable to state-of-the-art deep learning models
  while learning concise groupings conducive for clinical inspection.
