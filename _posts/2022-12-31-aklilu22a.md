abstract: Annotating medical images for the purposes of training computer vision models
  is an extremely laborious task that takes time and resources away from expert clinicians.
  Active learning (AL) is a machine learning paradigm that mitigates this problem
  by deliberately proposing data points that should be labeled in order to maximize
  model performance. We propose a novel AL algorithm for segmentation, ALGES, that
  utilizes gradient embeddings to effectively select laparoscopic images to be labeled
  by some external oracle while reducing annotation effort. Given any unlabeled image,
  our algorithm treats predicted segmentations as truth and computes gradients with
  respect to the model parameters of the last layer in a segmentation network. The
  norms of these per-pixel gradient vectors correspond to the magnitude of the induced
  change in model parameters and contain rich information about the modelâ€™s predictive
  uncertainty. Our algorithm then computes gradients embeddings in two ways, and we
  employ a center-finding algorithm with these embeddings to procure representative
  and diverse batches in each round of AL. An advantage of our approach is extensibility
  to any model architecture and differentiable loss scheme for semantic segmentation.
  We apply our approach to a public data set of laparoscopic cholecystectomy images
  and show that it outperforms current AL algorithms in selecting the most informative
  data points for improving the segmentation model. Our code is available at https://github.com/josaklil-ai/surg-active-learning.
