abstract: Increased use of sensor signals from wearable devices as rich sources of
  physiological data has sparked growing interest in developing health monitoring
  systems to identify changes in an individual’s health profile. Indeed, machine learning
  models for sensor signals have enabled a diverse range of healthcare related applications
  including early detection of abnormalities, fertility tracking, and adverse drug
  effect prediction. However, these models can fail to account for the dependent high-dimensional
  nature of the underlying sensor signals. In this paper, we introduce Latent Temporal
  Flows, a method for multivariate time-series modeling tailored to this setting.
  We assume that a set of sequences is generated from a multivariate probabilistic
  model of an unobserved time-varying low-dimensional latent vector. Latent Temporal
  Flows simultaneously recovers a transformation of the observed sequences into lower-dimensional
  latent representations via deep autoencoder mappings, and estimates a temporally-conditioned
  probabilistic model via normalizing flows. Using data from the Apple Heart and Movement
  Study (AH&MS), we illustrate promising forecasting performance on these challenging
  signals. Additionally, by analyzing two and three dimensional representations learned
  by our model, we show that we can identify participants’ VO2max, a main indicator
  and summary of cardio-respiratory fitness, using only lower-level signals. Finally,
  we show that the proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art in
  multi-step forecasting benchmarks (achieving at least a 10% performance improvement)
  on several real-world datasets, while enjoying increased computational efficiency.
