abstract: Despite significant progress in explainable Machine Learning (ML) tools
  (such as LIME, SHAP and explainable boosting machines) in explaining ML models’
  risk predictions in clinical problems (such as heart failure, acute kidney injury,
  sepsis and hypoxaemia during surgery), the interpretations generated remain to be
  an unfamiliar language to most clinicians. Clinical scores continue to be the preferred
  tool for risk stratification as they are concise, clinically correlatable and can
  be used at patient’s bedside without a machine. In this work, we reproduce the classical
  clinical scoring development approach to uncover its limitations in determining
  categorical features and using logistic regression coefficients to derive additive
  integer scoring systems. Subsequently, we propose the Unified Automatic Clinical
  Scoring (Uni-ACS) development framework, which overcomes these limitations to translating
  ML models into clinical scores by leveraging on explainable outputs from SHAP compatible
  ML models. We hypothesize that this approach is model agnostic, can be automated
  and can retain the complex predictive power of the underlying ML model, while relating
  key model insights to clinicians in a clinical risk scoring format. In our experiments,
  we applied Uni-ACS to a variety of ML models trained on the MIMIC III and MIMIC
  IV sepsis cohorts to predict mortality and ICU admission. We showed that Uni-ACS
  derived clinical score retained a greater proportion of the underlying ML models’
  predictive performance (lowest AUROC drop of 2.44%), compared against the baseline
  clinical score (lowest AUROC drop of 5.79%). We further verified Uni-ACS clinical
  score’s insights against the current literature to show its clinical applicability.
  Uni-ACS and datasets used for method validation are open-sourced for the community
  to use and verify.
