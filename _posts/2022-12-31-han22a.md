abstract: Survival analysis, the art of time-to-event modeling, plays an important
  role in clinical treatment decisions. Recently, continuous time models built from
  neural ODEs have been proposed for survival analysis. However, the training of neural
  ODEs is slow due to the high computational complexity of neural ODE solvers. Here,
  we propose an efficient alternative for flexible continuous time models, called
  Survival Mixture Density Networks (Survival MDNs). Survival MDN applies an invertible
  positive function to the output of Mixture Density Networks (MDNs). While MDNs produce
  flexible real-valued distributions, the invertible positive function maps the model
  into the time-domain while preserving a tractable density. Using four datasets,
  we show that Survival MDN performs better than, or similarly to continuous and discrete
  time baselines on concordance, integrated Brier score and integrated binomial log-likelihood.
  Meanwhile, Survival MDNs are also faster than ODE-based models and circumvent binning
  issues in discrete models.
