abstract: Multi-modal fusion approaches aim to integrate information from different
  data sources. Unlike natural datasets, such as in audio-visual applications, where
  samples consist of “paired” modalities, data in healthcare is often collected asynchronously.
  Hence, requiring the presence of all modalities for a given sample is not realistic
  for clinical tasks and significantly limits the size of the dataset during training.
  In this paper, we propose MedFuse, a conceptually simple yet promising LSTM-based
  fusion module that can accommodate uni-modal as well as multi-modal input. We evaluate
  the fusion method and introduce new benchmark results for in-hospital mortality
  prediction and phenotype classification, using clinical time-series data in the
  MIMIC-IV dataset and corresponding chest X-ray images in MIMIC-CXR. Compared to
  more complex multi-modal fusion strategies, MedFuse provides a performance improvement
  by a large margin on the fully paired test set. It also remains robust across the
  partially paired test set containing samples with missing chest X-ray images. We
  release our code for reproducibility and to enable the evaluation of competing models
  in the future.
