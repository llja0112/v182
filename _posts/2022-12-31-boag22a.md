abstract: In the last decade, machine learning (ML) has shown tremendous success in
  areas such as vision, language, strategic games, and more. Parallel to this, hospitals’
  capacity for data collection has greatly increased with the adoption and continuing
  maturation of electronic health records (EHRs). The result of these trends has been
  a large degree of excitement and optimism about how ML will revolutionize healthcare
  once researchers get access to data. In this work, we present a cautionary tale
  of the instinct some computer scientists have to “let the data speak for itself.”
  Using a popular, public EHR dataset as a case study, we demonstrate numerous examples
  where a non-clinician’s intuition may lead to incorrect – and potentially harmful
  – modeling assumptions. We explore both non-obvious quirks in the data (i.e., hypothetical
  incorrect assumptions) and examples of published papers that misunderstood the data
  generating process (i.e., actual incorrect assumptions). This case study is meant
  to serve as a cautionary tale to encourage every data scientist to approach their
  projects with the humility to know what they can do well and what they cannot. Without
  the guidance of stakeholders that understand the data generating process, data scientists
  run the risk of “garbage-in, garbage-out” analysis because their models are not
  measuring meaningful relationships.
