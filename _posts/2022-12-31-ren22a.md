abstract: There are several opportunities for automation in healthcare that can improve
  clinician throughput. One such example is assistive tools to document diagnosis
  codes when clinicians write notes. We study the automation of medical code prediction
  using curriculum learning, which is a training strategy for machine learning models
  that gradually increases the hardness of the learning tasks from easy to difficult.
  One of the challenges in curriculum learning is the design of curricula â€“ i.e.,
  in the sequential design of tasks that gradually increase in difficulty. We propose
  Hierarchical Curriculum Learning (HiCu), an algorithm that uses graph structure
  in the space of outputs to design curricula for multi-label classification. We create
  curricula for multi-label classification models that predict ICD diagnosis and procedure
  codes from natural language descriptions of patients. By leveraging the hierarchy
  of ICD codes, which groups diagnosis codes based on various organ systems in the
  human body, we find that our proposed curricula improve the generalization of neural
  network-based predictive models across recurrent, convolutional, and transformer-based
  architectures. Our code is available at https://github.com/wren93/HiCu-ICD.
