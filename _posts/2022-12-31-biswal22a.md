abstract: Deep generative models have enabled the automated synthesis of high-quality
  data for diverse applications. However, the most effective generative models are
  specialized in data from a single domain (e.g., images or text). Real-world applications
  such as healthcare require multimodal data from multiple domains (e.g., both images
  and corresponding text), which are challenging to acquire due to limited availability
  and privacy concerns and are much harder to synthesize. To tackle this joint synthesis
  challenge, we propose an End-to-end MultImodal X-ray genERative model (EMIXER) for
  jointly synthesizing x-ray images and corresponding free-text reports, all conditional
  on diagnosis labels. EMIXER is a conditional generative adversarial model by 1)
  generating an image based on a label, 2) encoding the image to a hidden embedding,
  3) producing the corresponding text via a hierarchical decoder from the image embedding,
  and 4) a joint discriminator for assessing both the image and the corresponding
  text. EMIXER also enables self-supervision to leverage a vast amount of unlabeled
  data. Extensive experiments with real X-ray reports data illustrate how data augmentation
  using synthesized multimodal samples can improve the performance of various supervised
  tasks, including COVID-19 X-ray classification with limited samples. Radiologists
  also confirm the quality of generated images and reports. We quantitatively show
  that EMIXER generated synthetic datasets can augment X-ray image classification,
  and report generation models to achieve 5.94% and 6.9% improvement on models trained
  only on real data samples. Overall, our results highlight the promise of generative
  models to overcome challenges in machine learning in healthcare.
