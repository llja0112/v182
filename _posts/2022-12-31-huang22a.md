abstract: Sepsis is the leading cause of death in intensive care units. It is challenging
  to treat sepsis because the optimal treatment is still unclear, and individual patients
  respond differently to treatments. Recent attempts to use reinforcement learning
  to provide real-time personalized treatment recommendations have shown promising
  results. However, the discrete action design (i.e., discretizing the continuum of
  action space into coarse-grained decisions) poses problems in policy learning and
  evaluation, and limits the effectiveness of the treatment recommendations. In this
  work, we proposed a continuous state and action space solution inspired by the Deep
  Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm. We performed qualitative evaluations
  and applied the direct method for off-policy evaluations. Our results match clinician
  performance and are more clinically reasonable and explainable than the state of
  the art.
