abstract: Learning visual representations of medical images (e.g., X-rays) is core
  to medical image understanding but its progress has been held back by the scarcity
  of human annotations. Existing work commonly relies on fine-tuning weights transferred
  from ImageNet pretraining, which is suboptimal due to drastically different image
  characteristics, or rule-based label extraction from the textual report data paired
  with medical images, which is inaccurate and hard to generalize. Meanwhile, several
  recent studies show exciting results from unsupervised contrastive learning from
  natural images, but we find these methods help little on medical images because
  of their high inter-class similarity. We propose ConVIRT, an alternative unsupervised
  strategy to learn medical visual representations by exploiting naturally occurring
  paired descriptive text. Our new method of pretraining medical image encoders with
  the paired text data via a bidirectional contrastive objective between the two modalities
  is domain-agnostic, and requires no additional expert input. We test ConVIRT by
  transferring our pretrained weights to 4 medical image classification tasks and
  2 zero-shot retrieval tasks, and show that it leads to image representations that
  considerably outperform strong baselines in most settings. Notably, in all 4 classification
  tasks, our method requires only 10% as much labeled training data as an ImageNet
  initialized counterpart to achieve better or comparable performance, demonstrating
  superior data efficiency.
