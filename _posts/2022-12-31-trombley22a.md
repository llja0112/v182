abstract: Deep learning has demonstrated impressive accuracy for prostate lesion identification
  and classification. Deep learning algorithms are considered black-box methods therefore
  they require explanation methods to gain insight into the modelâ€™s classification.
  For high stakes tasks such as medical diagnosis, it is important that explanation
  methods are able to estimate explanation uncertainty. Recently, there have been
  various methods proposed for providing uncertainty-based explanations. However,
  the clinical effectiveness of uncertainty-based explanation methods and what radiologists
  deem explainable within this context is still largely unknown. To that end, this
  pilot study investigates the effectiveness of uncertainty-based prostate lesion
  detection explanations. It also attempts to gain insight into what radiologists
  consider explainable. An experiment was conducted with a cohort of radiologists
  to determine if uncertainty-based explanation methods improve prostate lesion detection.
  Additionally, a qualitative assessment of each method was conducted to gain insight
  into what characteristics make an explanation method suitable for radiology end
  use. It was found that uncertainty-based explanation methods increase lesion detection
  performance by up to 20%. It was also found that perceived explanation quality is
  related to actual explanation quality. This pilot study demonstrates the potential
  use of explanation methods for radiology end use and gleans insight into what radiologists
  deem explainable.
