abstract: Depression is a very common mental health disorder with a devastating social
  and economic impact. It can be costly and difficult to detect, traditionally requiring
  a significant number of hours by a trained mental health professional. Recently,
  machine learning and deep learning models have been trained for depression screening
  using modalities extracted from videos of clinical interviews conducted by a virtual
  agent. This complex task is challenging for deep learning models because of the
  multiple modalities and limited number of participants in the dataset. To address
  these challenges we propose AudiFace, a multimodal deep learning model that inputs
  temporal facial features, audio, and transcripts to screen for depression. To incorporate
  all three modalities, AudiFace combines multiple pre-trained transfer learning models
  and bidirectional LSTM with self-Attention. When compared with the state-of-the-art
  models, AudiFace achieves the highest F1 scores for thirteen of the fifteen different
  datasets. AudiFace notably improves the depression screening capabilities of general
  wellbeing questions. Eye gaze proved to be the most valuable of the temporal facial
  features, both in the unimodal and multimodal models. Our results can be used to
  determine the best combination of modalities, temporal facial features, as well
  as clinical interview questions for future depression screening applications.
