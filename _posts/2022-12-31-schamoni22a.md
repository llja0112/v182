abstract: 'Ensembling neural networks is a long-standing technique for improving the
  generalization error of neural networks by combining networks with orthogonal properties
  via a committee decision. We show that this technique is an ideal fit for machine
  learning on medical data: First, ensembles are amenable to parallel and asynchronous
  learning, thus enabling efficient training of patient-specific component neural
  networks. Second, building on the idea of minimizing generalization error by selecting
  uncorrelated patient-specific networks, we show that one can build an ensemble of
  a few selected patient-specific models that outperforms a single model trained on
  much larger pooled datasets. Third, the non-iterative ensemble combination step
  is an optimal low-dimensional entry point to apply output perturbation to guarantee
  the privacy of the patient-specific networks. We exemplify our framework of differentially
  private ensembles on the task of early prediction of sepsis, using real-life intensive
  care unit data labeled by clinical experts.'
