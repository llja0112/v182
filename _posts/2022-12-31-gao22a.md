abstract: Healthcare providers usually record detailed notes of the clinical care
  delivered to each patient for clinical, research, and billing purposes. Due to the
  unstructured nature of these narratives, providers employ dedicated staff to assign
  diagnostic codes to patientsâ€™ diagnoses using the International Classification of
  Diseases (ICD) coding system. This manual process is not only time-consuming but
  also costly and error-prone. Prior work demonstrated potential utility of Machine
  Learning (ML) methodology in automating this process, but it has relied on large
  quantities of manually labeled data to train the models. Additionally, diagnostic
  coding systems evolve with time, which makes traditional supervised learning strategies
  unable to generalize beyond local applications. In this work, we introduce a general
  weakly-supervised text classification framework that learns from class-label descriptions
  only, without the need to use any human-labeled documents. It leverages the linguistic
  domain knowledge stored within pre-trained language models and the data programming
  framework to assign code labels to individual texts. We demonstrate the efficacy
  and flexibility of our method by comparing it to state-of-the-art weak text classifiers
  across four real-world text classification datasets, in addition to assigning ICD
  codes to medical notes in the publicly available MIMIC-III database.
