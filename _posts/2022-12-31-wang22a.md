abstract: Cascade Learning (CL) is a new and alternative form of training a deep neural
  network in a layer-wise fashion. This varied training strategy results in different
  feature representations, advantageous due to the incremental complexity induced
  across layers of the network. We hypothesize that CL is inducing coarse-to-fine
  feature representations across layers of the network, differing from traditional
  end-to-end learning, advantageous for medical imaging applications. We use five
  different medical image classification tasks and a feature localisation task to
  show that CL is a superior learning strategy. We show that transferring cascade
  learned features from cascade trained models from a subset of ImageNet systematically
  outperforms transfer from traditional end-to-end training, often with statistical
  significance, but never worse. We demonstrate visually (using Grad-CAM saliency
  maps), numerically (using granulometry measures), and with error analysis that the
  features and also errors across the learning paradigms are different, motivating
  a combined approach, which we validate further improves performance. We find the
  features learned using CL are more closely aligned with medical expert labelled
  regions of interest on a large chest X-ray dataset. We further demonstrate other
  advantages of CL, such as robustness to noise and improved model calibration, which
  we suggest future work seriously consider as metrics to optimise, in addition to
  performance, prior to deployment in clinical settings.
