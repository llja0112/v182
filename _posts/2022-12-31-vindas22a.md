abstract: 'When dealing with signal processing and deep learning for classification,
  the choice of inputting whether the raw signal or transforming it into a time-frequency
  representation (TFR) remains an open question. In this work, we propose a novel
  CNN-Transformer model based on multi-feature extraction and learnable representation
  attention weights per class to do classification with raw signals and TFRs. First,
  we start by extracting a TFR from the raw signal. Then, we train two models to extract
  intermediate representations from the raw signals and the TFRs. We use a CNN-Transformer
  model to process the raw signal and a 2D CNN for the TFR. Finally, we train a classifier
  that combines the outputs of both models (late fusion) using learnable and interpretable
  attention weights per class. We evaluate our approach on three medical datasets:
  a cerebral emboli dataset (HITS), and two electrocardiogram datasets, PTB and MIT-BIH,
  for heartbeat categorization. The results show that our multi-feature fusion approach
  improves the classification performance with respect to the use of a single feature
  method or other multi-feature fusion methods. Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art
  results on the HITS and PTB datasets with a classification accuracy of 93, 4% and
  99, 7%, respectively. It also achieves excellent performance on the MIT-BIH dataset,
  with an accuracy of 98, 4% and a lighter model than other state-of-the-art methods.
  What is more, our fusion method provides interpretable attention weights per class
  indicating the importance of each representation for the final decision of the classifier.'
