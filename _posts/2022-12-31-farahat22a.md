abstract: We propose a general framework for diagnosing brain disorders from Electroencephalography
  (EEG) recordings, in which a generative model is trained with EEG data from normal
  healthy brain states to subsequently detect any systematic deviations from these
  signals. We apply this framework to the early diagnosis of latent epileptogenesis
  prior to the first spontaneous seizure. We formulate the early diagnosis problem
  as an unsupervised anomaly detection task. We first train an adversarial autoencoder
  to learn a low-dimensional representation of normal EEG data with an imposed prior
  distribution. We then define an anomaly score based on the number of one-second
  data samples within one hour of recording whose reconstruction error and the distance
  of their latent representation to the origin of the imposed prior distribution exceed
  a certain threshold. Our results show that in a rodent epilepsy model, the average
  reconstruction error increases as a function of time after the induced brain injury
  until the occurrence of the first spontaneous seizure. This hints at a protracted
  epileptogenic process that gradually changes the features of the EEG signals over
  the course of several weeks. Overall, we demonstrate that unsupervised learning
  methods can be used to automatically detect systematic drifts in brain activity
  patterns occurring over long time periods. The approach may be adapted to the early
  diagnosis of other neurological or psychiatric disorders, opening the door for timely
  interventions.
